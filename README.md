   - DBSubnet
3. Deployed Azure App Service (Frontend)
4. Deployed Virtual Machine (Backend)
5. Deployed SQL Database (Data Layer)
6. Configured network security with NSGs for subnet isolation
7. Attempted to enable Azure Monitor / Application Insights, but sandbox restrictions prevented full monitoring setup
8. Documented all steps with screenshots

- Azure resource deployment and management
- Network configuration and subnet isolation
- Understanding of monitoring setup (Azure Monitor and Application Insights) despite sandbox limitations
- Troubleshooting Azure policy and sandbox restrictions
